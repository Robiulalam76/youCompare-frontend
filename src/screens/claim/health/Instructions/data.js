    question: "What Factors Affect Health Insurance Premiums?",

      "Age and previous medical history are significant factors that determine the premium amount. As you age, the premium cost tends to be higher due to increased susceptibility to illnesses. A clean medical history usually results in a lower premium. Additionally, claim-free years can also influence the premium cost, as they may qualify for a certain percentage of discount, thereby reducing the premium amount.",
