    question: "Should I Buy Comprehensive Insurance or Liability Policy Only?",
    answer:
      "When deciding between comprehensive insurance and a liability policy, it's essential to consider your specific needs and circumstances. Comprehensive insurance provides coverage for a wide range of situations, including damage to your own vehicle, theft, and third-party liability. On the other hand, a liability policy offers coverage only for damages caused to third parties. By opting for comprehensive insurance, you can have peace of mind knowing that your vehicle is protected from various risks. However, if you have an older vehicle or if cost is a significant factor, a liability policy may be a more affordable option. It's crucial to carefully assess your requirements and budget before making a decision.",

    question: "What is the Period of the Policy?",
    answer:
      "Typically, a motor policy is valid for one year and needs to be renewed before the due date. It's important to pay the premium on time as insurance companies generally do not offer a grace period for premium payment. If the policy lapses, even by one day, the vehicle will need to undergo an inspection. Additionally, if a comprehensive policy lapses for more than 90 days, the accrued benefit of No Claim Bonus (NCB) is also lost.",

    question: "What is No Claim Bonus (NCB)?",
    answer:
      "No Claim Bonus (NCB) is a benefit offered to policyholders who do not make any claims during the previous policy period. In India, the NCB typically ranges from 20% on the Own Damage premium and increases gradually up to a maximum of 50%. However, if a claim is filed, the NCB is forfeited in the subsequent policy period. It's important to note that the NCB is associated with the insured individual and not the insured vehicle. Therefore, if you transfer the vehicle to a new owner, the insurance policy can be transferred, but the NCB cannot. In such cases, the new owner will need to pay the difference in premium due to the NCB for the remaining policy period. However, the original owner can utilize the NCB on a new vehicle purchased by them.",

    question: "Will My No Claim Bonus Migrate if I Change Insurance Companies?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can avail the NCB facility if you switch insurers during renewal. To do so, you will need to provide proof of the NCB earned, such as a renewal notice from your current insurer. Alternatively, you can present your expiring policy along with a certificate confirming that no claims were made. This proof can be in the form of a renewal notice or a letter verifying the NCB entitlement from your previous insurer.",
